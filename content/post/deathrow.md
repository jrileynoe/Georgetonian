Last Monday, Sept. 14, Cai Changan, also known as Cai Ji Fan, escaped from the Class One Correctional Institution in Tangerang, just outside Jakarta, by digging through the prison’s sewage system. According to Tekdeeps, Yusri Yunus, Head of Public Relations for Polda Metro Jaya Kombes, said the following at the beginning of the week: “There was a drug convict of Chinese citizenship who temporarily went viral on social media who yesterday escaped by digging the ground and getting out through the culvert was caught by CCTV”.

The 37 year old, although from China, was incarcerated in Indonesia for trafficking over one hundred kilograms of methamphetamine, a synthetic stimulant, in 2017. According to the Guardian, he was also charged for possessing nearly seventy kilograms of methamphetamine in “chicken coop cleaner equipment”.

Cai was placed on death row and awaiting punishment when he made his escape. According to his cell mate, Cai had been plotting to make a break for nearly six months by using a crowbar, chisel, screwdriver and other equipment from ongoing construction in the prison’s kitchen to dig through the sewage lines. The resulting thirty-meter tunnel began in his cell and led to a road just outside the prison. Once the route was completed, Cai then carefully planned his final move to flee Tangerang. According to the Guardian, “Rika Aprianti, a spokeswoman for Indonesia’s directorate general of prisons, told media the trafficker…had timed his escape to the changing of the guards.”

This was not Cai Changan’s first encounter with law enforcement, nor his first escape from their facilities. Prior to serving his first sentence at the Tangerang Correctional Institution, Cai managed to break out of the National Police Criminal Investigation Department by busting a hole in a bathroom wall using an iron rod. With a few other prisoners in tow, Cai was able to traverse a two and a half meter wall and escape but was recaptured three days later in the West Java province of Indonesia.

Earlier this week, Indonesian law enforcement organized a team to locate Cai and gather more information surrounding his escape. They are still waiting for more information concerning his plans to emerge and attempting to gauge whether other people were involved. Cai’s cell mate states that he was invited to leave with Cai, but rejected the offer. Cai has since been placed on Indonesia’s most wanted list, yet there has been no comment made on his behalf by legal representation or family.
