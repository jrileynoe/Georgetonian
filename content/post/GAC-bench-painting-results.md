Tuesday, Sept. 22 was the first day of Fall. Its arrival brings with it the promises of pumpkin spice and warm apple flavors, fall colors, pumpkin carving and apple picking to excite our weekend agendas. On Georgetown’s campus, Fall brings forth excitement for the annual event, Songfest. However, due to COVID-19, these festivities have been pushed to the Spring, and Fall is looking different for students this year. Although the musical portion of Songfest has been moved, GAC decided to allow the bench painting competition to continue as normal. It has served as encouragement and has reminded us that we are still able to be together on campus despite the current pandemic. The competition was not without talent and creativity and many faculty, staff, and students were left in awe of the paintings that came out of the competition. Alex Courtenay, Georgetown’s Director of Student Engagement, said, “Everyone did amazing this year! All the benches were well done! There was so much creativity and artistic designs!”

The theme for the bench painting this year was “Tigers Together!” This has been a prominent theme throughout all of the semester thus far. Each building on campus added their own artistic spin to this theme, and the results were incredible. While each building deserved a prize for creativity, the results concluded that the best overall was Phi Mu’s “Apart So We Can Be Together” bench. As a reward for the hard work of the women who painted Phi Mu’s bench, all residents of the Phi Mu house will receive Steel City Pops. For those residence halls who placed in other categories, such as People’s Choice and Most Creative, they will receive an award plaque which they can proudly display within their residence hall.

For some of the women in Phi Mu, the win was unexpected but exciting, nonetheless. Morgan Frank describes the excitement of opening the GAC email about the results of the competition and seeing Phi Mu’s name under the “Best Overall” category. For those who spent hours working on the bench, their excitement was only heightened by the appreciation they shared for spending time with their sisters and communing with other residence halls during the competition. Avery Colvin said, “All of the benches this year were amazing and to be recognized as the best overall was super exciting! I’m really proud of my sisters who took the time out of their busy schedules to help paint! Shout out to the women of AGD for being great neighbors and encouraging our bench painting along the way!” Channing Baker agreed that spending time with her sisters “...while uplifting the whole Georgetown College community” was a blast. Emily Reedy said that the three days of painting were worth it and she enjoyed getting to spend quality time with her big, Avery Colvin.

All of the women of Phi Mu also agree that the other benches were well deserving of recognition. Morgan Frank said, “Everyone did so many cool things with the theme this year and all the benches were so thoughtful and creative.” Channing Baker recounted that Phi Mu’s bench was meant to “...represent the uniqueness of the women on campus and our efforts to be #tigerstogether”. The attitudes toward each residence hall during this competition and the paintings that came from it reflect well this united theme. Congratulations to the winners of each category.
