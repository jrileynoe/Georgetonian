As this first sub-session comes to an end, students are beginning to prepare for final exams. As always, final exams create a lot of tension and stress in students, and the opportunity to take study breaks is very welcomed. The ladies of Sigma Kappa and the men of Lambda Chi Alpha hosted an event to allow for the campus community to get out of their dorms and have some fun. 

Tuesday night, students were invited to the Lambda Chi House where an 80's themed social event was held, alongside Sigma Kappa. This event encouraged students to dress up in their best 80's outfit and get on the dance floor, or in this case, the basketball court, to take a break from homework, practices, or anything else that has been going on throughout the entire first half of the semester. 

It is important to highlight the precautions the women of Sigma Kappa and men of Lambda Chi Alpha took to prepare for this event. Because of all the restrictions with COVID-19, keeping social distance and wearing a mask at all times was highly stressed throughout the night. Regardless, both affiliations made sure that students were still having a good time. 

This event showed the entire campus that you can still have fun while following guidelines. Even if you have to wear a mask, some students found the enjoyment of pairing their mask with their 80's themed outfits. 

Throughout the next couple of days, students will be wrapping up their first couple of classes for the semester with finals. Although finals are deemed stressful, Georgetown College continues to offer events that let students take a break from their hard work while studying. 

Keep a lookout for more events, like the 80's themed event held by Sigma Kappa and Lambda Chi Alpha! You can find a campus-wide schedule on the Georgetown student portal.
