**Men’s Singles**

Dominic Thiem (Austria) took the win against Alexander Zverev (Germany) after losing the first two sets. The final scores were 2-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6. This is the first time someone has come back and won the US Open after being beaten in the first two sets. Men’s singles play best 3 out of 5 sets, so after winning the first two with just one more set needed to defeat Thiem, Zverev thought he was in a pretty good position.

Fans were shocked at how badly Theim was playing after his outstanding performance throughout the week. This could have influenced his attitude towards his opponent, who was predicted to be crushed by Thiem. He might have begun the match in a bit too comfortable of a mindset, causing his level of play to decrease. Thiem got his game back in the third set, winning 6-4 in the third and 6-3 in the fourth.

When it came down to the final set, each player only needed one more to win. Zverev was leading 5-3 when he started hitting errors, allowing Thiem to come back for a 7-6 win in the tiebreaker set. Tennis is a big mental game. These players both were in physical and mental agony throughout this dramatic finale. It was an incredible comeback for Thiem, but also a painful defeat for Zverev.

**Women’s Singles**

Naomi Osaka (Japan) defeated Victoria Azarenka (Belarus) with scores 1-6, 6-3, 6-3. Osaka’s win was impressive in itself, but she is also coming off a hamstring injury that caused her to cancel her play against Azarenka in the Western and Southern Open. Osaka struggled in the first set, losing 1-6 to Azarenka, but quickly came back to win the final two sets with a score 6-3 for both.

Women’s singles play best 2 out of 3 sets so, once again, it all came down to the final set. However, Osaka’s outstanding tennis play is not all that gained her attention at the Open. Osaka wore black masks with the names of victims of police brutality. She actively spoke out about the Black Lives Matter movement during her post-game interviews, saying that she wishes to spread awareness and get those hard conversations started amongst tennis fans. She stated, “The point is to make people start talking… For me, I feel like the more retweet it gets, that’s so lame, but the more people talk about it.” This is Osaka’s third grand title after winning the 2018 US Open and the 2019 Australian open.
