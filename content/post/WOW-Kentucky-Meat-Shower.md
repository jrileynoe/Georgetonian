I’m proud to present a homegrown wonder this week, with today’s story coming straight from Olympia Springs in Bath County, Kentucky—a small community located just under an hour from our own Georgetown. This week’s wonder might also take the prize for the weirdest so far, which means something coming from a column that opened with people dancing themselves to death.

The date was March 3, 1876, and Mrs. Allen Crouch was outside making soap when the darnedest thing happened: it started raining meat. Like snowflakes from clouds of prime rib, the meat landed all over the yard, with some pieces ending up impaled on nearby fenceposts. Most of the bits of meat were around two inches square, with the largest being twice that size. By Mrs. Crouch’s estimate, there was enough meat there to “fill a horse wagon full,” which sounds like a lot of meat.

Now, I don’t know how I would have reacted to a wagonload of chunks of meat plopping out of a clear sky into my yard, even in 2020, but the Crouches and their acquaintances seemed to live by the creed of “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” Or rather, “When strange meat falls from the sky, give it a taste test.” Thankfully, the only member of the Crouch household to make a full meal of the sky-meat was their cat (clearly a grateful feline in the vein of our friend Jeoffrey), but two men did taste enough of the raw mystery meat to decide that it might be mutton or venison, disproving Mrs. Crouch’s initial assumption that it was beef.

I would likely to reiterate the story: RAW MEAT fell from the SKY and TWO PEOPLE ATE IT. Apparently, not much was going on yet in March 1876, so when the story reached New York, reporters from the New York Times travelled to interview Mrs. Crouch and the other observers of the incident. The two men who tasted the meat also spoke to the reporters, but their names were not recorded. Were these brave souls afraid to attach their names to their death-defying deed? Seems so. Nevertheless, the testimonies of Mrs. Crouch, the taste-testers and a trustworthy local known as Mr. Harrison Gill were enough to convince the Times that the event had unquestionably happened, and the paper published the story on the 10th, a week after the meat shower occurred.

If you’re like me (or my roommates who had to hear about this story the minute I discovered it), you still have a lot of questions. Where did the meat come from? What kind was it? And, most importantly, what happened to the two guys who ate it? You might fear that they thanked God for the convenient cat food and went about their lives. And, honestly, we don’t know much of what the Crouches or their friends thought about the meat shower; however, we do know that someone thought to collect samples of the meat, allowing the search for an explanation to begin. After all, 1876 wasn’t as primitive as you might be thinking. On the same day that the New York Times published the story (under the fabulous title FLESH DESCENDING IN A SHOWER) Alexander Graham Bell would make his first telephone call. Scientific experiment was in an upswing, and scientists from all over the country jumped at the chance to categorize the mystery meat.

Three months after the meat shower, Leopold Brandeis announced his conjecture on the meat’s identity based on his examinations of a sample preserved in glycerin. He believed the meat to not be meat at all, but a cyanobacteria known as nostoc, also known as a number of entertaining nicknames: witch’s jelly, troll’s butter, star slubber, etc. Nostoc, which normally existed in a shriveled state, swells after a rain and before people realized this, they used to believe it fell from the sky like rain. It does indeed look like meat in its hydrated form and it reportedly tastes like chicken or frog. So, the meat was a vegan alternative all along?

Probably not. The flaws in Brandeis’s conclusion were quickly pointed out: March 3rd was a clear day and eyewitnesses saw the meat fall from the sky. Dr. A Mead Edwards also examined a sample and determined conclusively that the meat was in fact meat. He specified that it likely came from the lungs of a horse or human baby. Apparently, those two very different kinds of lungs look similar under the microscope. Edwards’ colleague Dr. J.W.S. Arnold and several other scientists would confirm that the meat was certainly animal in origin.

Before I tell you the mostly likely theory, I want to give an honorable mention to two more fantastical explanations. At one point, it was proposed that the meat came from two brothers who had been engaged in a knife fight when a tornado struck and scattered their remains over Olympia Springs. I think we’re all glad this wasn’t the case, but kudos to the morbid mind that concocted this twisted theory. Another unlikely version of events comes from William Livingston Allen, a humorist who gave his take on the meat shower in the New York Times the day following the initial story. Alden, playfully poking fun at scientific conjectures about outer space, speculated that the meat came from a meteor made of the mutton and venison of a destroyed planet, and that such meatfall would be so common as to become predictable as rain. Points for creativity, Alden.

Despite what this multitude of theories might suggest, the mystery didn’t linger long. Dr. L. D. Kastenbine, a chemistry professor of the Louisville College of Pharmacy, published the final and probably correct explanation in the 1876 edition of Louisville Medical News. After conducting his own experiments to prove that the meat is in fact meat, he says that the “only plausible theory” comes from an old Ohio farmer—like our infamous taste-testers, also unnamed—who suggested that the meat had been disgorged up by vultures passing at too great a height to be seen.

You read that right, folks: vulture vomit. This explanation has been endorsed as possible, too. Kentucky is home to turkey vultures that will vomit when they need to lighten their load and fly fast, and they’re sympathetic pukers, too: if one of the flock hurls, they all will. They’ve been known reach a height of 40,000 feet, a distance that would make them invisible to the naked eye and give their vomit the range described by the Crouches when it landed. An article derived from Kastenbine’s finding speculates that the meat had been poisoned with strychnine for coyotes, and the vultures were vomiting in response to that. (Makes you wonder even more what happened to our mystery-meat-eating friends, doesn’t it?) Although the vulture vomit theory can’t be definitively proven, it does seem to provide the best, if not most poetic, explanation.

As with all good stories, the vulture vomit doesn’t end with Kastenbine’s theory. First of all, the Kentucky meat shower is not an isolated event. Hundreds of strange precipitations have been recorded throughout history, though some have more basis in reality than others. The meat shower was gathered up with a number of these other odd skyfalls into the Charles Fort’s 1919 treatise “The Book of the Damned,” which also covers a rain of frogs in Ireland, fish in India, and butter in Missouri. In fact, the list of similar events just in the United States is so long that I can’t begin listing them without spending several hundred more words on the topic, but I have linked two articles on meat showers and red rains below.

The final oddity of this story comes in the form of jellybeans. Kurt Gohde, an art professor at Transylvania University, developed an interest in the meat shower well before he moved from New York to Kentucky. He was understandably giddy, then, when he discovered what looked like old bacon in a glass jar labeled “Olympia Springs” in 2004. Although the sample wasn’t good enough for genetic testing, it was good enough for a flavor analysis, so Gohde had a lab in Cincinnati synthesize the flavor of the meat and make jellybeans, which he then passed out at the 2007 Kentucky for Court Days in Mount Sterling. The consensus among this new batch of taste-testers was that the jellybeans, and therefore the meat shower, tasted like sugared bacon or strawberry porkchops with a metallic aftertaste. Yum?

Normally, I try to draw some deeper meaning out of the wonders I present here, but this story might be beyond moralization. Sometimes, weird stuff happens, people try to figure it out, and then they move on, leaving others to come along and be equally confounded. I guess all I can recommend is that the next time someone tells you that Kentucky is only known for second-rate wonders, like Mammoth Cave, the Derby, or Colonel Sanders, you correct them with pride and tell them all about the time some scientifically-minded Kentuckians ate buzzard vomit to figure out what kind of meat had rained from the sky.

[Note: In the last BackPage article, “Wonders of the World: Sister Rosetta Tharpe,” I listed lost or lesser-known female innovators. Since the article was published, I have learned about two more. Enheduanna, a Mesopotamian priestess, was the first author in recorded history to sign her name on her works (read her poems here: http://classicalarthistory.weebly.com/library/enheduanna-poems).  
Mildred Bailey was a jazz singer in the 1930s from the Coeur d’Alene tribe who helped Bing Crosby get his start as a big band singer (listen to her here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH0PYQriMBk).
I probably won’t keep updating my list, but I did want to share these two ladies who just happened to show up the week after I wrote about women like them.]
